I am currently studying Business Information Systems in GMIT. 
This course has provided me with insight into the IT aspect of business as well as teaching me how to work with Databases, Microsoft tools such as Excel and Access and also various other programs such as Adobe InDesign and Photoshop. 
I joined Coderdojo Athlone as a student in 2013 as I was interested in learning how to code and also how computers work.
Throughout my time at Coderdojo, I taught myself how to work with Web languasges such as HTML, CSS and also JavaScript.
I became a mentor in 2016 in the Web Development room.
