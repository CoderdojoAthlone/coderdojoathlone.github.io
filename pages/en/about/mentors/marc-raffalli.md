I have been working mainly as a Frontend developer (*HTML*, *CSS* and *JS*) for over 5 years, 
but I'm passionate about programming in general (and keyboard shortcuts!!) :D

Many aspects of programming are fascinating me: problem solving, attention to details, design...
On the opposite of a puzzle, there are infinite possibilities but not all work quite the same of course.  

I joined Coderdojo in 2016 as I wanted to start volunteering and put my experience to use.
It turns out I learn more from the kids in general than I can help in programming.
While I started in the buzzy busy Scratch room, you will find me now in the Web Development room.
