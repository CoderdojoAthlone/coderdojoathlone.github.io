I'm working as software engineer and volunteering few organizations.
Pursed B. Tech (ECE) from JNTU, India. Arrived to Ireland March, 2018 as part of my job.
Have good experience in Java and Web technologies. 
I like to learn technical topics, watch adventures, reading stories, volunteering and sharing knowledge with others.

Interested to volunteer for CoderDojo, as this is good platform to get new ideas from kids and learn the new way of thinking and assist kids to achieve.
