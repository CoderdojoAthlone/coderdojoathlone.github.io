Electronic class

The following provides information about the Athlone Coder Dojo electronics camp

## Objective

The objective is teach basic concepts of electronics to kids, learning physical computing in a fun informal way.
- Understand basic electronic components (e.g. a resistor, capacitor, diode, ..)
    - Distinguish between active and passive components and components polarity
- Understand how to read a basic electronic circuit diagram
- Creating basic circuits virtually using software tools
- Build circuits in teams using a breadboard, jumper cables and a variety of components
- Understanding voltage / current / resistance and their unit of measurement

    content="Those who attend are constantly reminded the dangers of experimenting with electronics
                     themselves without a full understanding of the possible consequences!"
  %}
    
- Learn about microcontrollers (Arduino)
- Learn to program an Arduino
   * Use "sketch" to create programs
   * Perform various hands on experiments using an Arduino
- Create various projects using Arduino (following Dojo projects)
- Conduct various mini projects throughout the year (2-3 weeks)
- Introduce the Raspberry Pi
   * Adventure through the world of physical computing with a Pi!
- Atendees can work towards coming up with own project ideas and/or collaborate and build a project as a team. Their project could then be entered into the annual [Coder Dojo Coolest projects](https://coolestprojects.org/) competition!

## Pre-requisites
- It is recommended that the course be undertaken by children 12 years and older
- It is assumed kids will have previously attended Scratch/Web CoderDojo sessions
- Children who attend should have a willingness to learn and have fun :-)

## Labs
Various hands on labs will be conducted throughout the year including:
- Use "Hot wires" snap circuits to build circuits
- Take apart a computer - understand various internal parts
- Bringing in old toys with motors
- Create circuits
- Tinkercad to create online circuits
- Learn about Microcontrollers using arduino labs (Dojo sushis)
    * Blinking LED
    * Traffic Lights
    * Temperature Sensors
    * Ultrasonic Range Sensor
    * LCDs
    * Motors
- Rasbperry Pi introduction
  - Basic introduction to Rasbian
  - Physical computing with Scratch (https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/physical-computing-with-scratch
  - Finding your way around a Raspberry Pi and using a shell
  - Basic linux commands
  - Using Pi to perform physical computing

## Group Projects

- Kids can enter [Coolest Project](https://coolestprojects.org/)
- Kids break up into groups come up with ideas for projects themselves. Alternatively perhaps mentors can assist / suggest project ideas.
- Some assistance from parents or the club may be required if the team want to use equipment which we don't currently have in stock
- If the kids want to build something themselves, they can bring their ideas. Mentors will assist.

## House rules

- Kids need to register their intention to join the group each week
- No food or drink permitted in the electronics lab
- Please be careful with the equipment you use - it the property of AIT or a volunteer
- Leave the venue in the same condition you found it in
- Tidy up and shutdown workstations when the session is over
- Be cool to your peers!
- Get to know the people in your group and HAVE FUN !

## What to bring

- Kids are welcome to bring along their own electronics kits, if they have them.
  - Breadboard, Resistors, LEDs
  - Arduino , Raspberry Pi
- Mentors will offer recommendations on kits to purchase if parents wish to consider this.
- The group mentors have a limited supply of electronic equipment which the group can use / share
- For those kids who bring their own kits, they take responsibility for looking after their own equipment.

## Other things to note

- If a quota of volunteers are not available in any particular week the course may not run or will run in a limited capacity
- At least two mentors must be available for a weekly session proceed. A single mentor cannot take a whole class in a classroom by themselves for safety reasons. 
- All mentors are garda vetted.
