I work as a software engineer for the past 20+ years.
I have a Nat Diploma in electronics and BEng (Hons) in Software Engineering from AIT.
Its a privilege to work in a field that you are most passionate about and get paid to do it.

I joined Coder Dojo for fun, it's great to help people discover new things and also learn from others.
My son and his friends have also joined the group. 

I've been programming/tinkering since I was ten years old. 
I enjoy constantly learning, I'm always curious how things work, I love building / creating things and sharing ideas.
