Coolest Projects gives young people the chance to showcase the great ideas they have created.
It inspires and rewards innovation, creativity, entrepreneurship, and technology skills.
If you’re up to 18 and you’re making something with technology for fun, to solve a problem, or as a creative outlet, then we want you to come out and share your project with us!

Project registration is now open! Young people can apply for Coolest Projects International up until **Sunday 5th April**.
See full details on [official article](https://coolestprojects.org/international/).
