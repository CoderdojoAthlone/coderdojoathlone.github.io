I have a varied tech background experience over the last 20 years 
from Desktop & Application Support, Network & Systems Administration, IT Management 
to my latest port of call of Validation Analyst at PPD here in Athlone

Started going to Coderdojo as a parent as thought it could help my son see the other side of how computer games are made.
Joined as a mentor in September 2017 as I thought while here I could help out and put my tech background to use.
Think Coderdojo is a great way for kids to learn programming and solve problems in a fun and friendly environment.
