#### Basic Electronic Components Summary


* Over the past number Dojo sessions we've learned a lot about basic electronic components including the following:
   * Resistor, Transistor, Capacitor, Relay, LED, Potentiometer, Integrated Circuit, Breadboard, Jumper Cables
* Each of these components are very well described on the [Electronics Club](https://electronicsclub.info/) site [https://electronicsclub.info/](https://electronicsclub.info/). We have used this site as a reference in a number of occasions.
* We have also covered the basic electronic concepts such as Resistance, Voltage and Current. Visit here for a recap on [Ohm's Law](https://www.ducksters.com/science/physics/ohms_law.php)

* Some of the team have found other useful references too (we will collate these and share these in another post ).
* We have built a lot of different circuits virtually using [Tinkercad](http://www.tinkercad.com) and it's helped us to understand how each of the components can be used to work together. 
* The circuits we've built virtually in already will be posted up on the site later. We will be revisiting circuits and building real circuits later.
* The following page on the Instructable site provides a useful summary and reference of what has been covered to date: 
    * **[Instructables Basic Electronics](https://www.instructables.com/id/Basic-Electronics/)**
* Now we have a good grounding, we'll switch our attention to the [**Microcontroller**](https://coderdojoathlone.com/en/resources/electronic-resources/microcontroller/)
