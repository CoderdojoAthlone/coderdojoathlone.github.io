I am currently in my second year of studying Business Information Systems in GMIT. This course involves me dealing with many different IT aspects such as database management, web development and also SQL coding. On top of this, we use Excel to manage data. We also learn about different IT aspects of Business and how to manage Information Systems such as ERP or CRM systems. Throughout my time in the course I also became proficient in using my different Adobe products such as InDesign, Photoshop and Premiere. 

I joined Coderdojo in 2013 as a ninja in the Web Development room. During my time in Coderdojo I learned HTML and CSS as well as a little JavaScript.I completed and entered my first website, a website on the Elder Scrolls game franchise, in Coolest Projects in 2014. In 2016 I became a mentor in the Web Development room.
