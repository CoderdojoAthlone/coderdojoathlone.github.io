I am currently studying Business Information Systems in GMIT. 
This is a great course as it has provided me with insight into the IT aspect of business as well as teaching me how to work with Databases, Microsoft tools such as Excel and Access and also various other programs such as Adobe InDesign and Photoshop. 
I joined Coderdojo Athlone as a student in 2013 as I was interested in learning how to code and also how computers work.
I became a mentor in 2016.
